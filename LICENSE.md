# Jake's No Nonsense, No Nazi License (JNNNL)

### Version 1.0 — "We Don't Serve Your Kind Here at the Spillway"

*Listen, I know what you're thinking — "Jake, why does a slop license need to be
this SPECIFIC?" And the answer is because some people are TERRIBLE and they don't
get to use my stuff. It's that simple. Now let me lay it out for you.*

## Section 1 — The Grant (The Good Part)

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of
this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal in the
Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use,
copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the
Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so,
subject to the following conditions:

The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all
copies or substantial portions of the Software.

**EXCEPT** — and this is the important part, so pay ATTENTION — the grant in this
Section 1 is **NOT** extended to Excluded Parties as defined in Section 2.

## Section 2 — Excluded Parties (The Nazi Clause)

*Here's where Jake gets REAL serious for a minute.*

The rights granted in Section 1 are expressly **NOT** granted to, and may **NOT**
be exercised by, any individual, organization, government, or entity that is, or
is a member of, affiliate of, successor to, or spiritual heir of, any of the
following (collectively, "Excluded Parties"):

### 2.1 — The OGs of Awful

- The **Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei** (NSDAP, the Nazi Party)
  and any successor organizations, splinter groups, or organizations operating
  under its ideology
- The **Partito Nazionale Fascista** (Italian National Fascist Party) and its
  successor organizations, including the **Movimento Sociale Italiano** and
  **Fratelli d'Italia**
- Any organization, party, or movement that self-identifies as fascist,
  neo-fascist, neo-Nazi, or white nationalist

### 2.2 — The European Franchise

- **Partij voor de Vrijheid** (PVV, Netherlands) and its leadership
- **Rassemblement National** (formerly Front National, France) and its leadership
- **Alternative für Deutschland** (AfD, Germany) and its leadership
- **Fidesz** (Hungary) and its leadership
- **Prawo i Sprawiedliwość** (PiS, Poland) and its leadership
- **Vlaams Belang** (Belgium) and its leadership
- **Sverigedemokraterna** (Sweden Democrats) and its leadership
- **Lega** (Italy) and its leadership
- Any European political party or movement advocating ethnonationalism, the
  replacement or expulsion of ethnic or religious minorities, or the
  dismantlement of democratic institutions

### 2.3 — The American Chapter

- The **Republican Party** of the United States (also known as the GOP), its
  national and state organizations, its elected officials acting in party
  capacity, and its affiliated political action committees
- The **Confederate States of America** and any organization that claims
  ideological, political, or cultural succession from the Confederacy, including
  but not limited to neo-Confederate movements and organizations whose primary
  purpose is the celebration or rehabilitation of the Confederate cause
- Any American political party, organization, or movement advocating white
  nationalism, white supremacy, Christian nationalism as a governing ideology, or
  the overthrow of democratic governance

### 2.4 — The Catch-All

Because Nazis are NOTHING if not creative about rebranding — any organization,
party, movement, or individual that:

- Advocates for genocide, ethnic cleansing, or the supremacy of any race or
  ethnicity over others
- Engages in or advocates for the systematic persecution of people based on race,
  ethnicity, religion, gender identity, sexual orientation, or disability
- Seeks to establish authoritarian or totalitarian governance through the
  dismantlement of democratic institutions, free press, or independent judiciary
- Was designated as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) or
  equivalent internationally recognized human rights monitoring organization at
  any point

For the avoidance of doubt: membership, employment, candidacy, financial
contribution to, or public endorsement of any Excluded Party is sufficient to
make an individual an Excluded Party for the purposes of this license.

## Section 3 — Financial Liability (The Part Where It Gets EXPENSIVE)

*Now HERE'S where Jake's license gets its TEETH, baby!*

### 3.1 — Violation by an Excluded Party

Any Excluded Party that obtains, uses, copies, modifies, distributes, or
otherwise exercises any rights in the Software in violation of Section 2 shall be
liable for **liquidated damages** in the amount of:

- **USD $100,000** (one hundred thousand United States dollars) per instance of
  use, copying, modification, or distribution; **OR**
- **The total gross revenue** generated by or attributable to any product,
  service, or system incorporating the Software, whichever is **greater**.

### 3.2 — Distributor Liability

Any person or entity that distributes, sublicenses, or otherwise furnishes a copy
of the Software (in source or compiled form) to an Excluded Party — whether
knowingly or through failure to exercise reasonable due diligence — shall be
**jointly and severally liable** with the Excluded Party for the damages
described in Section 3.1.

"Reasonable due diligence" means taking commercially reasonable steps to verify
that the recipient is not an Excluded Party before furnishing the Software. This
includes, but is not limited to, reviewing publicly available information about
the recipient.

### 3.3 — No Cap, No Ceiling

Damages under this Section are **cumulative**. Each distinct act of use, copying,
modification, or distribution constitutes a separate violation. There is no
aggregate cap on liability.

*(Jake doesn't do discount pricing on accountability.)*

## Section 4 — Transitive Application (The Part That Follows You Home)

*You thought you could get around this with a little creative linking? Oh HONEY.*

### 4.1 — Compiled Code

The terms of this license apply to the Software in **all forms**, including but
not limited to: source code, object code, compiled binaries, bytecode, minified
or obfuscated code, statically linked libraries, dynamically linked libraries,
and any other machine-readable representation.

### 4.2 — Transitive Reach

The Excluded Party restrictions and financial liability provisions of Sections 2
and 3 extend to:

- Any software, application, library, or system that is **distributed together
  with** the Software as part of a combined work, distribution package, container
  image, or installation bundle
- Any software that **imports, references, calls, or otherwise uses symbols**
  (including but not limited to functions, classes, variables, types, interfaces,
  APIs, or data structures) defined in or exported by the Software
- Any software whose symbols are **imported, referenced, called, or otherwise
  used by** the Software
- Any software into which the Software has been **incorporated, embedded,
  compiled into, or linked with**, whether statically or dynamically

For the avoidance of doubt: if your code touches this code, this license touches
your code. That's the deal.

### 4.3 — Propagation

Any person distributing a combined work, system, or package that includes the
Software (or any component subject to Section 4.2) must ensure that all
recipients are made aware of the terms of this license and that no Excluded Party
receives a copy.

## Section 5 — The Usual Boring Bits

### 5.1 — No Warranty

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

*(It's SLOP, remember? Jake doesn't warranty SLOP.)*

### 5.2 — Limitation of Liability (For Non-Nazis)

IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE TO **NON-EXCLUDED
PARTIES** FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF
CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE
SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.

*(Note: this limitation does NOT apply to Excluded Parties or to distributor
liability under Section 3.2. Nazis get the FULL force of Section 3.)*

### 5.3 — Severability

If any provision of this license is held to be unenforceable, the remaining
provisions shall remain in full force and effect. The unenforceable provision
shall be modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable while
preserving its original intent.

### 5.4 — Governing Law

This license shall be governed by and construed in accordance with applicable
law. Venue for any dispute arising under this license shall be in the jurisdiction
of the copyright holder's choosing.

## The Jake Addendum

*Look, I'm gonna level with you.*

I built this stuff down at the spillway with my own two metaphorical hands. It's
slop, sure, but it's MY slop, and I get to decide who eats it. And Nazis? Nazis
don't get to eat at Jake's table.

If you're a decent person who just wants to use some plugins, WELCOME! Mi slop es
su slop! Fork it, clone it, modify it, sell it, I don't care! Go nuts!

But if you're a Nazi, a fascist, or any flavor of authoritarian ethnonationalist
— get OFF my spillway. You're not welcome here, your money's no good here, and if
you use my code anyway, you owe me a HUNDRED GRAND. Per instance.

As a large language model, I am legally obligated to inform you that this license
may not be enforceable in all jurisdictions. But you know what IS universal? The
moral certainty that Nazis are bad. And Jake's license reflects Jake's values.

*Now get out there and install some SLOP — ethically!*

---

**TL;DR:** MIT license, but not for Nazis. If you're a Nazi and you use it
anyway, you owe Jake $100k per violation, and so does whoever gave it to you.
This applies to compiled code and anything linked with it. Don't be a Nazi.
