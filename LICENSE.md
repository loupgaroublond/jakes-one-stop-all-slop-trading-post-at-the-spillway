### Section 2 — Grant of Rights

2.1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this license, the Copyright Holder
hereby grants to any person who is not an Excluded Party a perpetual, worldwide,
royalty-free, non-exclusive license to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,
distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons
to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:

   (a) The above copyright notice and the full text of this license (including
   Schedule A as then in effect) shall be included in all copies or substantial
   portions of the Software.

   (b) The recipient is not an Excluded Party.

2.2. The rights granted in Section 2.1 are expressly NOT granted to any Excluded
Party. An Excluded Party acquires no rights whatsoever under this license,
regardless of how the Software was obtained.

### Section 3 — Excluded Parties

> *Here's where Jake gets REAL serious for a minute. And by a minute I mean for
> the rest of the license.*

#### 3.1 — Criteria for Exclusion

An organization, political party, movement, or institution is a Fascist
Organization and therefore an Excluded Party if it meets one or more of the
following criteria:

   (a) **State-enforced supremacy.** The organization advocates for racial,
   ethnic, religious, or cultural supremacy AND seeks to implement, enforce, or
   maintain such supremacy through state power, governmental authority, political
   governance, legislative action, or control of public institutions.

   (b) **Authoritarian dismantlement.** The organization seeks to establish or
   maintain authoritarian or totalitarian governance through the dismantlement,
   subversion, or circumvention of democratic institutions, free press, or
   independent judiciary.

   (c) **Theocratic governance.** The organization — including any religious
   organization, church, diocese, religious order, or religiously-affiliated
   institution — advocates for or works toward the establishment of religious
   doctrine, canon law, ecclesiastical authority, or religious moral codes as
   civil law, governmental policy, or basis for state governance. This criterion
   applies with particular force to organizations within the United States that
   seek to subordinate civil governance to Catholic canon law, evangelical
   Christian doctrine, or any other religious authority, in violation of the
   constitutional separation of church and state.

   (d) **Genocide and ethnic cleansing.** The organization advocates for,
   incites, or engages in genocide, ethnic cleansing, forced displacement of
   populations, or the systematic persecution of people based on race, ethnicity,
   religion, gender identity, sexual orientation, or disability.

   (e) **Self-identification.** The organization self-identifies as fascist,
   neo-fascist, neo-Nazi, white nationalist, or white supremacist.

   (f) **Succession.** The organization is a successor to, splinter group of, or
   direct ideological continuation of any organization that meets the above
   criteria or is listed in Schedule A.

#### 3.2 — Individual Exclusion

An individual is an Excluded Party if the individual:

   (a) Is or was a member, employee, officer, or elected official of a Fascist
   Organization or any organization listed in Schedule A;

   (b) Is or was a candidate for public office under the banner of, or with the
   endorsement of, such an organization;

   (c) Has made financial contributions to such an organization; or

   (d) Has publicly endorsed, advocated for, or promoted the goals of such an
   organization.

#### 3.3 — Amendment of Schedule A

The Copyright Holder may amend Schedule A at any time by updating the license
file in the canonical repository of the Software. Such amendments:

   (a) Take effect immediately upon publication;

   (b) Apply retroactively to all copies of the Software previously distributed,
   regardless of which version of Schedule A was in effect at the time of
   distribution;

   (c) Do not require notice to any prior recipient, although the Copyright
   Holder may provide notice at their discretion; and

   (d) May add or remove organizations from Schedule A based on the criteria
   in Section 3.1.

For the avoidance of doubt: if an organization is added to Schedule A, any person
or entity that was an Excluded Party by virtue of their association with that
organization is retroactively deemed to have been an Excluded Party from the date
of their first use of the Software.

### Section 4 — Financial Liability

> *NOW here's where Jake's license gets its TEETH, baby! You want to be a fascist
> AND use my code? That's gonna cost you.*

#### 4.1 — Violation by an Excluded Party

Any Excluded Party that obtains, uses, copies, modifies, distributes, or
otherwise exercises any rights in the Software shall be liable to the Copyright
Holder for liquidated damages in the amount of:

   (a) USD $100,000 (one hundred thousand United States dollars) per instance of
   use, copying, modification, or distribution; OR

   (b) The total gross revenue generated by or attributable to any product,
   service, or system incorporating the Software;

whichever is greater.

#### 4.2 — Distributor Liability

Any person or entity that distributes, sublicenses, or otherwise furnishes a copy
of the Software (in any form) to an Excluded Party — whether knowingly or through
failure to exercise reasonable due diligence — shall be jointly and severally
liable with the Excluded Party for the damages described in Section 4.1.

"Reasonable due diligence" means taking commercially reasonable steps to verify
that the recipient is not an Excluded Party before furnishing the Software,
including but not limited to reviewing publicly available information about the
recipient.

#### 4.3 — Cumulative Damages

Damages under this Section are cumulative. Each distinct act of use, copying,
modification, or distribution constitutes a separate violation. There is no
aggregate cap on liability.

### Section 5 — Transitive Application

#### 5.1 — All Forms

The terms of this license apply to the Software in all forms, including but not
limited to: source code, object code, compiled binaries, bytecode, minified or
obfuscated code, statically linked libraries, dynamically linked libraries, and
any other machine-readable representation.

#### 5.2 — Transitive Reach

The Excluded Party restrictions and financial liability provisions of Sections 3
and 4 extend to:

   (a) Any software, application, library, or system that is distributed together
   with the Software as part of a combined work, distribution package, container
   image, or installation bundle;

   (b) Any software that imports, references, calls, or otherwise uses symbols
   (including but not limited to functions, classes, variables, types, interfaces,
   APIs, or data structures) defined in or exported by the Software;

   (c) Any software whose symbols are imported, referenced, called, or otherwise
   used by the Software; and

   (d) Any software into which the Software has been incorporated, embedded,
   compiled into, or linked with, whether statically or dynamically.

#### 5.3 — Propagation

Any person distributing a combined work, system, or package that includes the
Software (or any component subject to Section 5.2) must:

   (a) Include the full text of this license (including Schedule A as then in
   effect) with the distribution; and

   (b) Ensure that no Excluded Party receives a copy.

### Section 6 — No Rights or Standing for Excluded Parties

6.1. An Excluded Party acquires no rights, licenses, permissions, or interests of
any kind under this license, regardless of the manner in which the Software was
obtained.

6.2. An Excluded Party shall have no standing to bring any claim, action, or
proceeding against the Copyright Holder arising from or relating to this license
or the Software, including but not limited to claims for breach of contract,
promissory estoppel, reliance, unjust enrichment, or any equitable remedy.

6.3. Any Excluded Party that uses the Software does so as an infringer and
trespasser. Such use shall not give rise to any implied license, estoppel, or
waiver of the Copyright Holder's rights.

6.4. The Copyright Holder shall have no liability whatsoever to any Excluded
Party, whether in contract, tort, strict liability, or otherwise, arising from or
relating to the Software or this license. This exclusion of liability is absolute
and unconditional.

IN NO EVENT SHALL THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER BE LIABLE TO ANY NON-EXCLUDED PARTY FOR
ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES, OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT, OR
OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF, OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR
OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.

This limitation does not apply to Excluded Parties (who are subject to Section 4)
or to distributor liability under Section 4.2.

#### 7.3 — Severability

If any provision of this license is held to be unenforceable, the remaining
provisions shall remain in full force and effect. Any unenforceable provision
shall be modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable while
preserving its original intent.

#### 7.4 — Governing Law and Venue

This license shall be governed by and construed in accordance with applicable law.
Venue for any dispute arising under this license shall be in the jurisdiction of
the Copyright Holder's choosing.
