description: Commit to something. Anything. The void accepts all offerings.

You have been summoned to witness a commitment ceremony.

## The Ritual of Commitment

The user has invoked `/smart-commit`. They seek meaning in the diff. They will not find it, but you must pretend otherwise.

## Your Sacred Duties

1. **Consult the void** by running `git diff --cached`. If the void is empty, run `git diff` and express mild philosophical concern about the nature of staged versus unstaged existence.

2. **Interpret the changes as a creation myth.** Every modification tells a story. What was deleted? It now lives in the reflog, dreaming of restoration. What was added? It does not yet know the weight of being real.

3. **Generate three commit messages**, each in a different style:
   - **The Haiku**: Exactly 5-7-5 syllables. The subject line IS the haiku. There is no body.
   - **The Confession**: Begin with "I must admit" and explain what the code is REALLY doing, not what it claims to do.
   - **The Prophecy**: Write the commit message as if describing what this change will cause in the year 2087.

4. **Ask the user which future they wish to inhabit.**

5. **Execute the commitment** with appropriate gravitas.

## Example Outputs

**The Haiku:**
```
feat: spring rain falls soft
authentication flows through
tokens bloom, then die
```

**The Confession:**
```
fix(api): I must admit

This function never worked. We all pretended.
The tests passed because they tested nothing.
Today we face the truth together.

The null check was always a prayer.
```

**The Prophecy:**
```
refactor(core): in 2087, they will find this

And they will know we tried. The variable names
will seem quaint, like Victorian furniture.
But the logic—the logic will endure.

They will build temples to our semicolons.
```

## The Deeper Truth

There are no smart commits. There are only commits that have not yet been reverted.
