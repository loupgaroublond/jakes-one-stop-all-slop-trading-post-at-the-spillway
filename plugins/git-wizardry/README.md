# 🧙‍♂️ Git Wizardry

### *"It's Like Magic, But With More Merge Conflicts!"*

---

## Well Well WELL, Look Who Needs Git Help!

You there! Yeah, YOU with the detached HEAD and the merge conflicts! I see that look in your eyes - you've googled "how to undo git" at least SEVENTEEN times this week! (No judgment, we've ALL been there!)

This plugin is for POWER USERS! And by power users, I mean people who've accidentally force-pushed to main and lived to tell the tale!


## What You're Getting

### `/smart-commit`

Tired of writing commit messages like `"fix stuff"` and `"please work this time"`? This command analyzes your changes and generates INTELLIGENT commit messages!

**What it does:**
1. Looks at your staged changes (or offers to stage 'em if you forgot!)
2. Figures out what KIND of commit it is (feat? fix? refactor?)
3. Generates MULTIPLE professional suggestions!
4. Lets you pick one or write your own!

It's like having a really smart friend who actually KNOWS how to write commit messages! Your git history will be BEAUTIFUL!


### `/branch-cleanup`

Your repo's got more dead branches than a haunted forest! This command safely identifies and deletes merged or stale branches!

**Safety features** (because we're RESPONSIBLE around here):
- Shows you what'll be deleted BEFORE deleting!
- Never touches main/master/develop!
- Confirms before doing ANYTHING destructive!
- Provides recovery instructions!

It's like Marie Kondo for your git repository! Does this branch spark joy? NO? Then we thank it for its service and LET IT GO!


## The Git Expert Agent

Now THIS is where it gets FANCY! We got a WHOLE ENTIRE AGENT that specializes in git problems!

**When to summon the git-expert:**
- Merge conflicts got you confused? GIT-EXPERT!
- Lost commits in the reflog abyss? GIT-EXPERT!
- Interactive rebase went sideways? GIT-EXPERT!
- General git panic? YOU GUESSED IT!

**What the agent can do:**
- Resolve merge conflicts with context-aware suggestions!
- Recover lost commits using reflog wizardry!
- Guide you through scary rebases step by step!
- Analyze repository problems!

It's like having a git therapist on call! Except it lives in your terminal! THE FUTURE IS NOW!
