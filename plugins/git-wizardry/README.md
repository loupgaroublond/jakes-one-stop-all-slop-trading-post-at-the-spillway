# 🧙‍♂️ Git Wizardry

## 🚨 HOLD UP - READ THIS FIRST! 🚨

**THIS IS PLACEHOLDER SLOP!**

Okay folks, I gotta come clean - this plugin is NOT REAL! It's a DEMO! A MOCKUP! A BEAUTIFUL LIE!

We created this to show what a plugin marketplace LOOKS LIKE, but there's no actual functioning code here! It's like a Hollywood set - looks great on camera, but walk around back and it's just plywood and hope!

Want a REAL plugin that actually WORKS? Go check out the [Claude Self-Improvement Toolkit](../claude-self-improvement) - THAT one's authentic!

This here? This is just PLACEHOLDER SLOP! (Jake's specialty!)

## Attention All Git Users!

You ever been in one of those git situations where you're like "I don't know WHAT I did but everything's on FIRE"? Well my friend, have I got NEWS for you!

This here plugin is for POWER USERS! And by power users, I mean people who've googled "how to undo git" at least SEVENTEEN times! (No judgment, we've ALL been there!)

*EXCEPT this plugin is FAKE! It's a CONCEPT! The actual commands don't DO anything! Read the disclaimer above!*


## The Arsenal (What You're Getting)

### `/smart-commit`

Analyzes your changes and generates INTELLIGENT commit messages following conventions! It's like having a really smart friend who actually KNOWS how to write commit messages!

**What it does:**
1. Looks at your staged changes (or offers to stage 'em if you forgot!)
2. Figures out what KIND of commit it is (feat? fix? "oh god what have I done"?)
3. Generates 2-3 PROFESSIONAL commit message suggestions
4. Lets you pick one or write your own!

**Commit types it knows:**
- `feat`: New features (the good stuff!)
- `fix`: Bug fixes (the necessary stuff!)
- `docs`: Documentation (the stuff nobody reads but should exist!)
- `refactor`: Code restructuring (made it pretty!)
- `perf`: Performance improvements (made it FAST!)
- `test`: Tests (finally being responsible!)
- `chore`: Boring maintenance stuff!

**Example:**
```
/smart-commit

Analyzing staged changes...

Suggested commits:
1. feat(auth): add OAuth2 authentication flow
2. feat(auth): implement social login providers
3. auth: add OAuth2 support with Google and GitHub

Which one you want? Or type your own! I'm not your boss!
```


### `/branch-cleanup`

Safely identifies and deletes merged or stale branches! It's like Marie Kondo for your git repository!

**Safety features** (because we're RESPONSIBLE around here):
- Shows you what'll be deleted BEFORE deleting (we're not MONSTERS!)
- Never touches main/master/develop (protected like Fort Knox!)
- Confirms before doing ANYTHING destructive!
- Provides recovery instructions (just in case!)

**What it finds:**
- Merged branches (safe to delete!)
- Stale branches (no commits in 90+ days - time to let go!)
- Your current branch (NOT deleted, you're safe!)

**Example:**
```
/branch-cleanup

Found 5 merged branches and 2 stale branches.
Ready to clean up? I'll show you everything first!
```


## The Git Expert Agent

Now THIS is where it gets FANCY! We got a WHOLE ENTIRE AGENT that specializes in git problems!

**When to summon the git-expert:**
- Merge conflicts got you confused? GIT-EXPERT!
- Lost commits in the reflog abyss? GIT-EXPERT!
- Interactive rebase went sideways? GIT-EXPERT!
- General git panic? YOU GUESSED IT - GIT-EXPERT!

**What the agent can do:**
- Resolve merge conflicts (with context-aware suggestions!)
- Recover lost commits (using reflog wizardry!)
- Guide you through scary rebases (step by step!)
- Analyze repository problems (like a git therapist!)

**Example scenario:**
```
You: I have merge conflicts in auth.ts and I'm panicking!

Claude: Let me invoke the git-expert agent...

git-expert: Alright, let's see what we got here...
*reads the conflicted file*
*analyzes both versions*

The conflict is in your login function. Your version uses JWT tokens,
their version uses session cookies. Based on your codebase, you're using
JWT everywhere else, so let's keep your version.

Here's the resolved code: [shows solution]
Here's how to accept it: [provides commands]
```

It's like having a git expert on call! Except it's an AI! Living in your terminal! THE FUTURE IS NOW!


## Installation

From Jake's All-Slop Trading Post:
```
/plugin install git-wizardry@all-slop-marketplace
```

Or locally (if you're a "trust no one" type):
```
/plugin install ./plugins/git-wizardry
```


## Features That Make This Worth It

In my professional opinion as someone who has used git for *checks notes* several years, this plugin provides:

- 🎯 **Smart commits** (consistent history, happy team!)
- 🧹 **Branch cleanup** (less clutter, more clarity!)
- 🧙‍♂️ **Expert agent** (for when things get REAL!)
- 🛡️ **Safety first** (confirms before destroying your life's work!)
- 📚 **Educational** (actually explains what it's doing!)


## Real-World Use Cases

**Daily Workflow:**
- Use `/smart-commit` for EVERY commit! Your git history will thank you!
- Run `/branch-cleanup` weekly! (Or monthly if you're lazy like me!)

**Emergency Situations:**
- Merge conflicts? Ask the git-expert!
- Lost commits? git-expert's got your back!
- Rebase disaster? git-expert to the rescue!

**Team Collaboration:**
- Consistent commit messages = happy code reviewers!
- Clean branches = less confusion in the repo!


## Pro Tips from Jake

As an AI-powered git consultant (that's a thing now, I decided), here's my advice:

1. **Commit message consistency** - Let `/smart-commit` analyze first, then customize if needed! It's like having a writing coach!

2. **Branch hygiene** - Run `/branch-cleanup` before starting new features! Clean repo, clean mind!

3. **Don't panic** - When git gets scary, remember: the git-expert agent has seen WORSE! Probably!

4. **Learn while fixing** - The git-expert EXPLAINS what it's doing! You'll actually LEARN git! (Revolutionary, I know!)

## License

MIT - Use it! Modify it! Sell it for millions and don't tell me! (But if you DO make millions, remember who sold you this plugin for FREE!)

**BUT REMEMBER:** This is PLACEHOLDER CODE! It's here to demonstrate plugin structure! You can use it as a TEMPLATE to build your own git plugin, but don't expect it to work out of the box! It's EXAMPLE SLOP!
