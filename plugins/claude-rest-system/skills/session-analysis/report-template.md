# Report Template

This template provides structure for rest analysis reports. **Adapt as needed** - not every section applies to every analysis, and the format should serve clarity, not constrain it.

When the situation warrants different organization (e.g., a single deep-dive session, unusual findings, or cross-cutting themes), adjust the format accordingly.

# Rest Analysis: {YYYY-MM-DD} {HH:MM}

Analyzed sessions S<first>-S<last>, <total> messages.


## <Domain Name>

**<Finding Title>** (S<n>)

<Narrative paragraph explaining what happened, why it matters, and the outcome. Include specific values, field names, error messages, command syntax. Reference evidence with [M#start-end] notation.>

## Analysis Methodology

### Storage
Location: `<storage_path>`

### Session Selection
- Total sessions found: <n>
- Sessions analyzed: <n>
- Sessions skipped: <n> (reason if any)
- Selection criteria: <how sessions were chosen>

### Session Processing Strategy
- S<n> (<session_id>, <count> messages): <approach used>
  - <details of searches run, regions extracted>
- S<n> (<session_id>, <count> messages): <approach used>

### Search Patterns Used
- Error indicators: `error|failed|exception|Error|Failed`
- Learning moments: `I see|understood|learned|realized|makes sense`
- User corrections: `no,|actually|wrong|try again|that's not`
- Friction points: `confused|unclear|not sure|don't understand`
- Domain-specific: `<any additional patterns used>`

### Decision Points
- <Key decisions made during analysis>
- <Why certain findings were highlighted over others>
- <Any patterns that emerged across sessions>

### Findings Distribution
- Learning (L): <count> findings
- Mistakes (M): <count> findings
- Outcome breakdown: <success/failure/partial counts>

### Temporal Context
- S<n>: <date> (<relative to analysis date>)
- <Any observations about session relationships>

## Flexibility Notes

**Adapt this template when:**
- Single session warrants chronological narrative instead of domain grouping
- Findings are tightly related and better presented together
- Unusual patterns emerge that don't fit domain categories
- Context would be lost by rigid structure

**Always include:**
- Session references (S<n>)
- Evidence ranges [M#n-m]
- Keywords for drill-down
- Methodology section
