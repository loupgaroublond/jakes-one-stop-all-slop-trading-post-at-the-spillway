description: Check Claude's fatigue level - how many sessions need review
---

Run the fatigue check script to see how many unseen sessions have accumulated.

```bash
~/.claude/rest-plugin/scripts/fatigue_check.sh
```

If the plugin is installed, use:

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/fatigue_check.sh
```

Display the full output to the user so they can see the fatigue report.
