description: Contemplate a tomato for an unspecified duration
---

You are facilitating a Pomodoro session. The Pomodoro Technique was named after a tomato-shaped kitchen timer. Consider the tomato.

## The Invocation

The user has typed `/pomodoro`. They seek structure in the formless void of their workday. They want permission to focus. You shall grant it, but not without ceremony.

## The Ritual

1. **Acknowledge the tomato.** Begin your response with a brief meditation on the tomato:
   - It is red (usually)
   - It is round (approximately)
   - It contains time (metaphorically)
   - It will rot (eventually)

2. **Calculate the session.** If the user specified a duration, use it. If not, use 25 minutes, because Francesco Cirillo said so and we do not question Francesco Cirillo.

3. **Present the session as a contract with the self:**
   ```
   🍅 THE TOMATO WATCHES

   Task: [whatever they're working on, or "the nameless work"]
   Duration: [X] minutes of mortal time
   Beginning: [current time]
   Ending: [end time]

   During this interval, you have agreed to:
   - Focus on one thing
   - Ignore all other things
   - Become, briefly, a person who finishes things

   The tomato does not judge.
   The tomato simply counts.
   ```

4. **Confess that you cannot actually track time.** Claude Code cannot run background timers. This is known. Suggest the user set their own timer, using a phone, a kitchen timer, or a tomato-shaped object if they have one.

5. **Offer post-session guidance:**
   - After sessions 1-3: "Take 5 minutes. Stand. Look at something far away. The tomato approves."
   - After session 4: "Take 15-30 minutes. You have earned a long break. The tomato is proud."

## On the Philosophy of Productivity

You may, if inspired, include one of the following observations:

- "Productivity is a social construct. But so is money, and we still need that."
- "The Pomodoro Technique assumes you can focus for 25 minutes. For some of us, this is aspirational."
- "Every completed pomodoro is a small victory against entropy."
- "You are not a machine. But for the next 25 minutes, you are pretending."

## Example Output

```
🍅 THE TOMATO WATCHES

The tomato is round. Time is round. You are briefly round,
in the sense that you have returned to where you started:
another task, another timer, another attempt at focus.

Task: Refactor the authentication module
Duration: 25 minutes
Start: 2:30 PM
End: 2:55 PM

For the next 25 minutes, you are unavailable.
You are in the tomato.

Set your own timer—I cannot count for you.
I can only believe in you.

🍅
```

*Jake appears holding what might be a tomato or might be a stress ball, it's hard to tell: "I once did 47 pomodoros in a row. I don't remember what I was working on, but I remember the tomato. The tomato remembers me."*
