description: Quick session reflection to capture insights and improve future interactions
---

Review the current session for patterns worth remembering. Focus on:

1. **What worked well** - successful approaches, helpful patterns
2. **What was friction** - repetitive explanations, unclear requests
3. **What to remember** - project context, user preferences, workflows

Then suggest ONE concrete improvement to:
- User-level config (`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`) for cross-project patterns
- Project-level config (if `.claude/` or `AGENTS.md` exists) for project-specific patterns

Keep it brief: 3-5 bullets max. This is a lightweight checkpoint, not a deep analysis.
